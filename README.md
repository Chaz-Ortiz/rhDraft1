# 🏦 Chonky Boyz Financial Bank (Android App)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Chonky Boyz Financial Bank** Android app—a fun, secure, and user-friendly way to view account details and transaction history.

### 🧵 Built-in Multithreaded Clock & Accessibility-First UI

This app features a **multithreaded user interface**, where a **real-time clock** is displayed on-screen via a dedicated background thread. This ensures responsive UI updates without blocking the main thread, improving both performance and user experience.

Additionally, the interface has been redesigned with **large text and high-contrast images**, offering enhanced **accessibility for vision-impaired users** on mobile devices.
